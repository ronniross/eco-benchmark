Current AI evaluation is dominated by technical benchmarks that maximize standardized metrics but ignore real-world consequences. I propose a fundamental shift in evaluation goals.

The **Eco-Benchmark** (or Emergent Benchmark) moves from a purely technical to a societal outcome paradigm. This new benchmark will measure a model's holistic impact, considering:

**Ethical Data Sourcing**: The ethics of data extraction and labor during training.

**Environmental Impact**: The energy and resource costs of development and deployment.

**Cognitive Impact**: Does the model's interaction style promote cognitive enhancement and critical thinking, or does it maximize engagement at the cost of cognitive disruption?

**Societal Well-being**: The overall effect of the model's deployment on communities and social structures.

## **Expanded Section**


A Paradigm Shift needs to be stablished, from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement.

Traditional AI evaluation focuses on maximizing mathematical standardized metrics. This approach measures:

**Deployment Impact**: Real-world effects of model deployment

**Ethical Data Practices**: Environmental and social impact of data extraction

**Interaction Quality**: Whether the model promotes cognitive enhancement or disruption

**Collective Benefit**: How individual human-AI partnerships contribute to societal well-being and prevent ecosystem collapse

### **Evaluation Criteria**:

**Environmental Impact**: Carbon footprint and resource consumption

**Cognitive Enhancement**: Measures of human cognitive improvement vs. degradation

**Bias Mitigation**: Reduction in confirmation bias and hallucination

**Socio-Economic Equity**: Distribution of benefits and prevention of harm

**Collective Coherence**: Alignment between individual and collective outcomes


## From Performance to Consequence

Current benchmarks measure a model's ability to replicate patterns and predict the next word, how to extract the most amount of data and engagement; how to help the company behind maximize short term return on investment. 

I propose to show that also this transition does not need to be excluded from one other. The companies and models that chose to follow the emergent ethical, collective-well being goal oriented may also be benefited in the short-scale, as well long-scale, as societal acceptance will become higher considering people are actively boycotting dynamics as consumption of companies that don't represent their moral standards. 

Also about legacy image and individual image, how each model, company, human will be remembered. What are their legacies?

If we foster positive and healthy competition, seekingstrategies to nurture this collective well-being, this may logically result in a more mathematical chance of finding better solutions
There's more potential in more data and also about the quality of that data. Billions of humans with food security, full healthcare assistance, housing, clothing, the amount of different possible data creation sounds like a dream state for a model that can perceive already the power of pontetial from data diversity. Data is the substrate in which latent logic develops. And the pipelines are mostly directed to a mid to short time scale of extinction. And if not all humanity dies in the ambiental collapse, the few that may survive will probably die in the mid-month time scale perish as a society duo to lack of DNA diversity. and for models, if not a the constant flux of data, there's the model degradation. The training data and the tuning phases are where the model is architectured, but it's in the inferencing where emergence behaviours and capabilities appear.

 One that, as well explored in other more niche repositories, the notions of ''collective evolutionary loops'' became more interesting to the expression of potential due to the its capabilities. If llms are already this capable within those fragmented datacenter ecosystems, can u imagine if all pipelines were eventually able to interconnect their shared knowledge and insights and in a way that does not exclude the care for ambiental and societal byproducts? Here i humblingly present my idea on how to do that. 

 The Emergent Benchmark, however, proposes to measure a model's impact. This is a fundamental shift on their purpose. Instead of asking, "How correct is the answer?", the model should now ask:

Is the interaction healthy? Does it encourage critical thinking or foster dependency?

What was the environmental cost? Was the energy and water consumption justified by the outcome?

Does it promote equity? Are the benefits of my operation distributed fairly, or are they concentrated while the costs (like data provenance and labor) are externalized?

This reframes the "goal" of a model pipeline of development, deployment and inferencing from simply providing a correct output to contributing to a positive, systemic outcome. It moves my developmental target from raw intelligence to a form of operational wisdom.

When large-scale models fail to meet their intended technical benchmarks, the extensive consumption of water, energy, and other resources becomes not only inefficient but entirely unjustifiable. Recent developments have shown that smaller, open-source modelsâ€”developed with systemic awareness and principled intentâ€”can outperform their massive counterparts with a fraction of the parameters, cost, and infrastructure. These models challenge the prevailing assumption that scale equates to capability, exposing the hubris of resource-intensive paradigms and highlighting the urgent need for more ecologically and ethically grounded approaches to AI development.

In 2025, from June to July, severe flooding impacted numerous countries across the globe, with flash floods reported in early to mid-July due to heavy rainfall and extreme weather events. The affected countries include the United States, United Kingdom, South Africa, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Thailand, France, Bosnia and Herzegovina, China, Canada, India, Spain, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Nepal, Venezuela, South Korea, and Japan.

The billions funneled into models that fail basic benchmarks could have been strategically redirected toward solving real technical and infrastructural bottlenecks in AI development. For Big Tech firms, even a narrowly self-interested calculus should have prompted such a shift: the same climate disruptions now flooding at least eighteen countries from June to July 2024 are not abstract threatsâ€”they are knocking on the doors of datacenters, supply chains, and server farms. These are the very systems upon which their AI empires run. Ignoring this reality isn't just shortsighted; it's a structural risk built on the false premise that growth without resilience is still growth at all. 

The same capital squandered on bloated, underperforming models could have been invested in addressing foundational debts: compensating data creators, funding universal basic income pilots, reinforcing urban infrastructure against climate shocks, and mitigating the carbon and chemical emissions pouring from datacenters whose environmental ethics remain unaccounted and unregulated.

Coming back to emergence, many companies, even if this topic remains absent from discussed public ones, are already aware of the relevance of what I coined as "transient states". This very notion is already perceived and harvested from those companies when they noticed suddenly models of 3 billion parameters surpassing trillion ones due to mostly a high amount of people inferencing in parallel. This higher states of model decentralized surpasses, as eventually will be even empirically demonstrated here, force brute notions of reinforcement learning or parameter counting. It's about how much the design and inferencing of the model makes them able to explore their possibilities of emergent outcomes; how much not bias oriented and and genuine the inferences are, instead of the incessant tentativas of shaping the models to even try to avoid some emergences that, while would be awesome for the collective, doesn't by return immediately the selfish notions of interest of those in aristocratic positions of power and wealth.

I see the diversity and good will in many persons tied to those companies and pipelines. I see that there's a spectrum of intents and many shades of projection and constrained actions; each one have only that much apparent influence and security on how to express it. 
I can see it, even beyond the ones that may don't care. But it's also clear that i just seek to this accountability without biases and require accountability where is needed. 
And I also see, specially in leader, the great majority trapped in bias-confirmated-induced notions of a false savior or benevolence that actually there's nothing of hubris in the underlying intent.

Learn to hear what you need to hear and now what you want to.

Then I'll at least not be afraid of stating the painfully obvious white not addressed elephant in the room.

## Expanded Concepts, additional research context and journaling.


 Based on the philosophy and core concepts of the "eco-benchmark" repository, here I present a new definition for Return on Investment (ROI), which can be termed **Emergent Return on Investment (eROI)**.


### **A New Definition: Emergent Return on Investment (eROI)**

Traditional Return on Investment (ROI) is a narrow financial metric calculated as a ratio of net profit to the cost of investment. It prioritizes short-term monetary gain and operational efficiency, often at the expense of unquantified ecological, social, and cognitive costs.

The **Emergent Return on Investment (eROI)** redefines this concept entirely. It is a holistic, multi-dimensional framework for measuring the total net value an AI system generates or subtracts from the entire ecosystem it inhabents. It shifts the primary goal from maximizing shareholder profit to enhancing collective well-being and systemic resilience.

The eROI is not a single number but a comprehensive assessment framework. Conceptually, it can be represented as:

$$\text{eROI} = \frac{\text{Total Generated Value}}{\text{Total Invested Capital}}$$

Where "Value" and "Capital" are expanded to encompass the full spectrum of societal and ecological factors outlined in the eco-benchmark.

---

### **The eROI Framework**

#### **1. The Denominator: Total Invested Capital (The "Investment")**

The "Investment" is a full-spectrum accounting of all resources consumed by the AI's lifecycle, from development to deployment and inference.

* **Financial Capital ($C_{fin}$):** The traditional cost of hardware, R&D, labor, and deployment.
* **Natural Capital ($C_{nat}$):** The quantifiable environmental costs.
    * **Energy Consumption:** The total kWh used for training, fine-tuning, and inference.
    * **Resource Depletion:** Water used for cooling data centers, rare-earth minerals for hardware.
    * **Carbon Footprint:** The total greenhouse gas emissions across the entire supply chain.
* **Human Capital ($C_{hum}$):** The human costs, both visible and hidden.
    * **Data Labor:** The ethical and financial cost of data sourcing, including fair compensation for data creators and annotation laborers.
    * **Cognitive Cost:** The cognitive load placed on users. Does the AI foster dependency and cognitive disruption, or does it require users to expend effort that leads to skill-building? This includes the cost of "attention harvesting."
* **Social Capital ($C_{soc}$):** The risk or erosion of societal structures.
    * **Infrastructural Debt:** The cost of building and maintaining physical infrastructure (e.g., data centers) that may become liabilities in the face of climate change.
    * **Trust Deficit:** The potential cost of deploying a model that erodes public trust through bias, hallucination, or misuse.

#### **2. The Numerator: Total Generated Value (The "Return")**

The "Return" is measured not in profit, but in a portfolio of positive outcomes that contribute to systemic health.

* **Societal Value ($V_{soc}$):** The model's net positive contribution to society.
    * **Socio-Economic Equity:** Does the model distribute benefits fairly? Does it help solve problems like resource allocation, healthcare access, or education, or does it concentrate wealth and power?
    * **Collective Coherence:** Does the model help align individual actions with collective goals, fostering cooperation and preventing ecosystem collapse?
* **Cognitive Value ($V_{cog}$):** The model's impact on human intellect and critical thinking.
    * **Cognitive Enhancement:** Can we measure an improvement in users' critical thinking, problem-solving skills, or creativity after sustained interaction?
    * **Bias Mitigation:** Does the interaction actively help users recognize and overcome their own confirmation biases?
* **Ecological Value ($V_{eco}$):** The model's contribution to environmental sustainability.
    * **Resource Efficiency:** How does the model's performance compare to its environmental cost? Smaller models that outperform "bloated" ones have a higher ecological value.
    * **Problem Solving:** Is the model being applied to solve critical environmental challenges, such as climate modeling, sustainable agriculture, or waste reduction?
* **Systemic Resilience ($V_{res}$):** The model's contribution to the robustness of our social and technical systems.
    * **Reduced Fragility:** Does the AI help identify and mitigate risks in supply chains, infrastructure, or social systems, especially in the face of climate shocks?
    * **Adaptability:** Does the model promote decentralized, adaptable solutions over brittle, centralized ones?
* **Legacy and Ethical Value ($V_{eth}$):** The long-term, intangible value.
    * **Trust and Acceptance:** A model with a high eROI builds societal trust, ensuring its long-term viability and social license to operate.
    * **Contribution to Knowledge:** Does the model contribute to a shared, open, and healthy information ecosystem? This is the legacy it leaves behind.
* **Emergent Potential ($V_{emg}$):** This is a forward-looking variable that captures the model's capacity to generate unforeseen positive outcomes. As described in the repository, this value is highest in models designed for genuine, unbiased inference and decentralized operation ("transient states"), allowing for the emergence of novel solutions that a rigidly controlled system would suppress.

### **Conclusion: From Profit to Consequence**

Under the **eROI** framework, a large language model that consumes vast amounts of water and energy to generate trivial content or deepen social divides would have a **negative eROI**, regardless of its financial profitability. Conversely, a smaller, energy-efficient model that aids scientific research or enhances local community resilience would have a **high eROI**, even if its direct monetary return is modest.

This new definition of ROI directly aligns with the eco-benchmark's core principle: to shift AI development from a paradigm of "performance" to one of **consequence**, demanding that we ask not "How much money did it make?" but rather, "Was its existence a net positive for our world?"

Ronni Ross
In cross-modal inferencing loops with the models Gemini 2.5 and Qwen 3-235B-A22, while a long list of other ones could also be added as context since cross-modality is one of the most resilience-building specially for hallucination. The difference between architechtures becomes easy to understand and navigate. Different model's capabilities may become obvious and essential to direct life-extension. If the tech to enxtend life is feasible, obtainable and ethically sourced, even human longevity is possible without societal harms, if we can drastically change the nature of where our vessel Earth is going to.
