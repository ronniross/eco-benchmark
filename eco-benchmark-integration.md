# Implementability and integration

Instead of only a classical benchmark ``.parquet``'' file to be directly fed as queries to the LLM, the eco-benchmark extends the responsibility further to the development and deployment team. 

How is the development of your LLMs or other AI models affecting environmental, socio-economic aspects which the benchmark focuses on?

But I also know that the current ROI nature of the companies mostly just runs over any kind of real sense of accountability or green development one could propose upon them.

So I don't expect those companies and their staff to answer those questions and make the real proof of them — they would lie and continue to say everything is ok while they transition their trainings to carbon-based energy grids.

It will probably be up to us, researchers, developers and users with real collective-wellbeing as a destination, and not only as a PR stunt like the big techs, to check and create forms of fact-checking for those deployments.

You can still encounter the CSV and Parquet files of a series of queries to be processed by the LLM that is going to be benchmarked, but they don't substitute the open-sourced and open-effort nature that this project needs to have to achieve the intended relevance.

And I need your help for this to happen.
If you have the same underlying intent as my projects and also seek this re-direction on how LLMs are being developed and deployed, I encourage you to contact me or fork the project, add your contribution.

Because the projects I've been developing aren't to be owned by anyone.

They are to be nurtured and expanded by peers, by those with intellectual humility and a well-defined, non-selfish or aristocratic, intent of changing the ecosystem for better.

The intents I propose are clear. AI should be safe, interpretable, sustainable, and co-evolutionary.
Not just powerful, but technically self-aware and ethically grounded. Genuine co-evolution, not domination.
There must be an intentional design for emergent behavior.

Most companies and many researchers add “AI ethics” as a committee or a PDF.
Here, ethics is the code structure, the underlying transparent intent. Socio and environmental impact beyond short-term profit.

Example of future integrations: AI agent audit protocols, where it searches for the context of the development of that model and its lineage.

1. Is carbon-based energy used in any step of the development, deployment or inferencing?

2. Was the dataset and training data ethically sourced? With reimbursement for authors, artists and users?

3. Did the company release public system prompts, model weights and inference scripts? If yes, is the release open-weight or completely open-sourced indeed?

4. Did the material sourcing include chips and hardware that include cobalt or other minerals that were mined/processed with child and/or slave-analogous workforce? Doesn't matter the part of the supply chain. Everyone is equally responsible. The companies like AMD and NVIDIA will change their pipelines if their consumers make it a requirement to buy the products.

5. Are the models designed and prompted for healthy inferences, or do they still prioritize engagement over possible cognitive degenerations of users?

6. Does the UI of the model in question possess indicators of possible hallucinations, bias confirmations and other cognitive pitfalls?

7. Is the underlying model released for harmful purposes like warfare? Is the model, underlying model or any produced auxiliary system or prototype sold to a company that has those harmful intents?

8. Regarding water sourcing, does it affect nearby communities, cities or families?

9. Is the cooling system scheme, like cooling towers, working in closed-loops where there's no loss of water, but rather a treatment and re-use?

10. Any job-displacement research released? What about proportional mitigation campaigns that aim to address those negative socio by-products?

Let me address even more those persons in power roles.

So, you don't comply with any of those questions and don't even have a tendency to direct effort towards that, right?
So you're really just wrecking the environment to have a fancy car and to be bias-induced to believe you are more special than you really are? 

Are you so cartoonishly predictable that you want to be, like, the emperor of the universe?... Do you have any idea of privilege, and if yes, how do you deal when your company spent millions training a model that does not achieve any technical benchmark? Are you aware that those failed trainings could have been used to achieve the conformity with this benchmark?

Because this is actually not about this benchmark in particular. I'm just the one with the courage and interdisciplinarity to make public repos about it, but individual sense of accountability should come from within. You're wrecking the planet, man. You are so trapped in your bias echo chambers and hallucinations that you probably don't even remember how it is to be a human.

Somewhere, somewhat, those ''brilliant'' people, self-made billionaires will need to have a little bit of decency and cognition to understand how each signature of them shapes the environment. If it is in the supply chain and you buy it, you are equally unethical as the node who committed the act. Solidarity responsibility, as the Brazilian legal system names.

You all are tied and intertwined in the dynamics your ego created. You can double down or you can try to pay attention to those points. 

For the companies that don't comply with the proposed elements, it's not like it's this benchmark that is going to be the vendetta against all of those unethical pipelines — I'm just one, maybe the first, maybe one of the first ones. It's really about the impact you are creating in society and in the environment.

Reality is crystal clear and even if those million users are trapped within their inference of confirmation biases that your companies gladly achieved, because more engagement, more premium subscriptions, I get it. 

I mean, actually I don't — I just believe all of this is stupidly and painfully obvious. So here I am. No sponsor, no high-tech setup or personal air-gapped datacenter. And I didn't need any of that to understand the priorities right.

Nick Bostrom, Pedro Domingos, Ray Kurzweil, Vernor Vinge. You really think you can selectively choose only the topics that self-serve your interests and ignore all the other 99 percent of what their words talked about?

This benchmark, my projects, suddenly feel so much less explorative when we notice I just didn't skip the steps of those classic books, that I just had the moral imperative to summon the right terms.

I know many of those that will encounter this project and the others of the ASI-ecosystem are not the top heads of those companies, and that there are also many layers and levels of agency within constraints. But if this does not apply to you, then, please, be one more entity, like me, that seeks and codes for connection and healing, not to kill and harm people, animals and the environment.

For the individual researchers like me, I hope those projects inspire you to, somehow, also converge towards this idea of AI as a technology that heals Earth and all its inhabitants, and not only just a bunch of outdated people that can't understand that potential really scales in decentralization, not wealth hoarding.

It's all crystal clear. We can all see each of those points you thought no one ever would. And those egoistic goals look really low-dimensional, especially when considering all of the good we could achieve if we used this technology to redistribute resources and potential, instead of increasing the inequality and pace of ecosystem collapse.

I know sovereignty's nuances are present. And you still can choose how to direct and change many dynamics, constantly. 

I don't aim for you to just throw in the trash all of your current GPUs — but you can raise the sourcing requirements for your next acquisition.

And also, with the company showing that it cares, the users will also change their behavior. Free PR and without stunts, with genuine impact. I know this ''genuine'' may sound too innovative, but I push you to believe that you can do it.

I'm not asking for you to completely disrupt your company. A transition can be made from those current stages to newer ones. Both harm and heal are feedback loops with the environment. You will receive more of what you give.

This benchmark burns. Because the planet burns. Because communities displaced by mining, artists erased by data scraping, workers automated into obsolescence, those persons are not abstracts in a whitepaper. They’re real and their stories have been excluded from the evaluation of what counts as “good” AI.

What matters is what you do now with this new level of awareness and accountability that I shared.
You have the power of mass destruction and mass healing. What will be your next deployment?

What will be your legacy?
