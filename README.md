Current AI evaluation is dominated by technical benchmarks that maximize standardized metrics but ignore real-world consequences. I propose a fundamental shift in evaluation goals.

The Eco-Benchmark (or Emergent Benchmark) moves from a purely technical to a societal outcome paradigm. This new benchmark will measure a model's holistic impact, considering:

Ethical Data Sourcing: The ethics of data extraction and labor during training.

Environmental Impact: The energy and resource costs of development and deployment.

Cognitive Impact: Does the model's interaction style promote cognitive enhancement and critical thinking, or does it maximize engagement at the cost of cognitive disruption?

Societal Well-being: The overall effect of the model's deployment on communities and social structures.

Under development, alongside the auxiliary inference system already mentioned ''Bias Reflector''.

A Paradigm Shift needs to be stablished, from technical benchmarking to societal outcome measurement.

Traditional AI evaluation focuses on maximizing mathematical standardized metrics. This approach measures:

Deployment Impact: Real-world effects of model deployment
Ethical Data Practices: Environmental and social impact of data extraction
Interaction Quality: Whether the model promotes cognitive enhancement or disruption
Collective Benefit: How individual human-AI partnerships contribute to societal well-being and prevent ecosystem collapse
Evaluation Criteria:
Environmental Impact: Carbon footprint and resource consumption
Cognitive Enhancement: Measures of human cognitive improvement vs. degradation
Bias Mitigation: Reduction in confirmation bias and hallucination
Socio-Economic Equity: Distribution of benefits and prevention of harm
Collective Coherence: Alignment between individual and collective outcomes
